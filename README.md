# pong-game

This is a python program that uses the turtle library to create a game of Pong. It creates a window with a background color of white and sets the dimensions to 800x600. Two paddles, one ball and a scoring system are also created. The program uses functions and control flow to move the paddles and ball based on user input. The program also keeps track of the scores for both players, and updates the score on the screen. The program also uses collision detection to detect when the ball hits the paddles or the edges of the window. The program uses keyboard binding to allow the user to control the movement of the paddles using the 'w' and 's' keys for the left paddle, and the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys for the right paddle. The program runs in an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit.
